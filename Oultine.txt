This is going to be a program that allows a user to mass add or remove users, as well as add/remove groups from users.

The plan for this is to allow a user to upload a text file filled with user names to the program, and from there, choose what they would like to be done with this user group.

This will probably have little to no use in the real world

TO DO
- Extract Users from text file (users should be seperated by a new line)
- Create functions for add user, remove user, add group to user, remove group from user
